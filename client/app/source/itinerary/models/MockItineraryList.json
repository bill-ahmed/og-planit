A path leads from the torii gate in Lake Ashi up a series of steps flanked by lanterns through the forest to the main building of the shrine, which sits peacefully among the tall trees. The shrine is beautiful throughout the year, and is particularly breathtaking when shrouded in mist.",

It also has a cold water bath, as well as an old fashioned sauna: just put some salt on your body, and enter the small structure located close to the bath and lay or sit down... until the temperature just is unbearable!",

The base of the waterfall is easily accessible from the road via a walking trail in just a few minutes.",
