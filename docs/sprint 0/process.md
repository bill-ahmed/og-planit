• Reflect on how your team worked together.
• Here are a few questions that can guide you

• How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

We organized our team initially by what experience each person had. Since Bilal had backend expereince, and Lintao had Front end experience, we determined that they would be the leads foreach of those sections respectively. The rest of us then decided what part each person wanted to work on, front or back end. 

• How did you make decisions?

Generally we defered to those who have more experience, but major decisions are a majority vote.

• How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average), did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

We defined priority based on the requirements that the PO gave us. The PO gave us a list of "must haves" and a list of "good to haves" and we ordered priority of those based on this list. For the story points, we used a planning poker website where we uploaded all the user stories we added to the sprint and rated them based on how hard they seemed to implement. We generally came to an agreement as to deciding how hard a given user story was. Most of the group either thought the stories seemed easy or hard to implement with very few in the middle

• Did you meet in person or online?

We meet primarily online through Discord but some members do meet in person

• How frequently did you meet?

 We meet weekly at team meetings that take plac on Fridays online with emergency meetings whenever an issue comes up.

• What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

We need to meet more often and arrive to meetings on time. We also need to better communicate tasks to group members
