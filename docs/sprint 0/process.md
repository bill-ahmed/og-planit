• Reflect on how your team worked together.
• Here are a few questions that can guide you
• How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
We organized our team initially by what experience each person had. Since Bilal had backend expereince, and Lintao had Front end experience, we determined that they would be the leads foreach of those sections respectively. The rest of us then decided what part each person wanted to work on, front or back end. 
• How did you make decisions?
Generally we defered to those who have more experience, but major decisions are a majority vote.
• How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average)
We defined priority based on the requirements that the PO gave us. The PO gave us a list of "must haves" and a list of "good to haves" and we ordered priority of those based on this list
did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
• Did you meet in person or online?
• How frequently did you meet?
 We meet weekly at team meetings that take plac on Fridays online with emergency meetings whenever an issue comes up.
• What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
