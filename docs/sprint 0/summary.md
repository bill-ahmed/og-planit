## Project Details
**Objectives:** 
* To help individuals find locations and events that will interest them
* Provide an intuitive method of adding locations/events to an itinerary, and being able to share it with others as well
* Consolidate information from many sources into one outlet, such as Price, Distance, Start/End times, and more
* Provide essential navigation to/from each destination within an itinerary
* And much more...

**Users:** 
* Individuals who like to travel and/or looking to explore a particular region of interests and will possibly go outside their comfort zone to try new experiences
* Users also consist of locals who may not be aware of interesting events/locations within their own region
* People that are indecisive when it comes to deciding where to go


**Scenarios:** Some key scenarios based on the users mentioned above include

1. Suzy is in Vancouver for the weekend and is staying with her friend, Lisa, who's lived there for over 20 years now. Being from a small town up-north, Suzy is giddy with excitement at the thought of exploring downtown Vancouver. Lisa, however, is not not as excited because she doesn't go out very often, and so she is dumbfounded when Suzy asks her for recommendations.

2. From a young age, Albert has been very bad at deciding what to do next. He's lived in his hometown of Halifax for over 25 years and thinks he has seen it all. One afternoon, after being locked up in his room for 3 days straight with only Pringles and Lindt chocolate to survive on, Albert is yearning to try something new in his hometown.


**Principles:** The following are some key principles that our project will aim to follow
1. Provide a clean and intuitive UI
2. Viewing, adding, modifying and deleting itineraries will be central focus
3. Adaptable to most popular types of users
