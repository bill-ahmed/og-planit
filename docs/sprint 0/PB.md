• State your team’s numerical series you do intend to use to estimate user stories (examples from tutorials).
• Identify the most important user stories.
• How many user stories? We are not sure. Enough to give us (and you) a good sense of the scope of
the project.
• As a guideline: a user story (usually) corresponds to a feature in your project.
• Any number between 3 and 20 might be appropriate.
• Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the criteria of
satisfaction.
• Each user story should include a priority and a point estimate (using the numerical scale stated above).
• Point estimate is a qualitative estimate, made by the team members. You will need to use planning
poker as in tutorials.
• Additionally, all stories in PB.md, need be recorded on Jira.
