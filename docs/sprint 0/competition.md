PlanIt's Competition:

1) TripIt: Travel Planner (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripit&hl=en_CA)

Our product actively suggests travel destinations, while TripIt relies on the user to have such knowledge.
Our product is better for users who do not have a clear travel destinations in mind, because one focus of our product is to offer suggestions to build a suitable itinerary.
The competition may have wanted to keep TripIt as more of a tool for the user to organize their trip, rather than make it a personal tour guide. TripIt will have to focus more on the personal preferences of the user (collect more data) to implement features in this aspect.

2) Cultural Places - Travel Guide & Planner (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cpapp)

This competitor is more similar in that it offers recommendations for travel destinations, but it is more generalized and less personal.
Our product is better for users who know what type of activities/types of places they prefer.
e.g. A tourist who hates museums will not see any museums in our recommendations.
Our product is more personalized rather than showing everything that is around.
As the name suggests, this competitor is focused more on showing the culture behind travel destinations, rather than focusing on becoming a personal tour guide. The competitor would need a rebrand to focus more on understanding the user's preferences, rather than focusing on each destination's cultural information as a recommendation.
